        <div class="content">
        <div class="title_p">Introduction</div>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is the official privacy policy of Singulart. It applies to all personal information
            collected by Singulart via any related Singulart website, social media page, internal website or intranet;
            any
            Singulart mobile or tablet application and from an individual via any other means, including physically or
            electronically.</p>

        <p>In this policy we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it and disclose it,
            and
            what controls you have over our use of it. We appreciate that you may have certain concerns about how your
            personal information is collected, used and shared. We can assure you that we will always handle your
            personal
            information securely and carefully. Among other things, we comply with all applicable Australian privacy
            laws
            including the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

        <p>In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, there may also be specific and additional privacy and
            consent provisions that apply to certain Collection Channels. Because those specific and additional
            provisions
            also relate to your privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In the event
            of
            any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and those other specific and additional
            provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Anonymity and Pseudonymity</div>
        <p>You have the option of dealing with Singulart anonymously. However, this only applies where it is practicable
        for Singulart to deal with you acting anonymously or under a pseudonym, such as a general enquiry.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Collection of Information</div>
        <p>Throughout this privacy policy we refer to ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù, which means information or an opinion about
        an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is
        true or not and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. Your first and last
        name, date of birth, gender, home address, contact telephone number, mobile telephone number, email address and
        employment details are examples of information which may constitute personal information. Personal information
        may also include information we may collect about your individual preferences.</p>

        <p>Some information provided to us by customers, contractors and other third parties might be considered to be
        personal information. We will only collect such personal information if it is necessary for one of our functions
        or activities. The kinds of personal information that Singulart collects are set out below.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Information that you provide to us</div>
        <p>We collect personal information that you provide directly to us, such as when you make a purchase, register for
        an account or enter a competition or promotion. This may include:</p>
<p>
        - your name;
        - your contact details including your email address, delivery address, phone number and social media handles;
        - more detailed contact preferences;
        - information regarding your experiences with our products and services;
        - employment and company information such as the name of your employer.</p>

        <p>Information that we collect from your use of our websites and apps
        When you use a website or an app, we may also collect personal information about you in the following general
        categories:</p>

       <p> - Location information: if you permit a website or an app to access location services through the permission
        system in your mobile device, we may collect the precise location of your device.
        - Transaction information: we collect your transaction details when you place an order, including the products
        you have ordered, the date and time of your order and the amount charged.
        - Usage and preferences: we collect information about how you interact with our websites and apps, including the
        pages you visit, your preferences and settings that you choose. We may do this through the use of cookies and
        other similar technologies that uniquely identify you.
        - Device information: we may collect information about your device such as the hardware model, operating system,
        preferred language, unique device identifier and mobile network.
        - Other information: we may also collect and log information such as your IP address, access dates and times,
        browser type and pages visited when you interact with our websites and apps.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Information that we collect from third parties</div>
        <p>In addition to the information listed above, in some cases we may collect personal information about you from
        legitimate third party sources including social media sites and list broker and other data providers that share
        data in circumstances where it is lawful and/or they have your permission to do so.</p>

        <div class="title_p">This may include:</div>

    <p>- When you choose to create an account or register for a product or service via our websites and apps using a
        social media platform such as Facebook or Google;
        - When a third party has your consent to disclose your personal information to us, such as when you enter a
        competition or promotion administered by a third party on our behalf;
        - When it is otherwise lawful for a third party to disclose your personal information to us, such as when we
        access purchasing information through our business partners or are provided data by a list broker.</p>

        <div class="title_p">How Singulart collects, uses and discloses personal information</div>
        <p>At or before the time the personal information is collected by us, we will take reasonable steps to provide you
        with a collection statement to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain
        access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the type(s) of organisations to which
        we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information
        and the main consequences for you if all or part of the information is not collected. We will not collect or
        monitor any personal information about you without your consent, included as provided in this privacy policy.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Active information collection</div>
        <p>In particular, Singulart will collect your personal information from you in the following situations:</p>

    <p>- If you contact Singulart, we may keep a record of that correspondence;
        - When you participate in any offers, promotions or marketing activities;
        - When you apply for and/or establish and/or access an account or order a product;
        - When you conduct certain types of transactions such as cheque purchases or refunds;
        - When you submit your e-mail address via our websites and apps or provide us with personal information via any
        medium, including our websites and apps;
        - When you place an order via our websites and apps to purchase goods, in which case we may require you to
        provide us with contact information including your name, address, telephone number or email address;
        - When you interact with our websites and apps for a specific purpose; and
        - When you use or browse our websites and apps generally.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Cookies and Passive Information Collection</div>
    <p>As you navigate through our websites and apps, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered
        without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or
        web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, and clickstream data). For example, we
        may collect information about matters including but not limited to the date, time and duration of visits and
        which pages of our websites and apps are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to the
        identity of visitors, except where our websites and apps are accessed via links in an email or another
        electronic message we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user accessing our
        websites and apps, such as when you are logged into an account.</p>

    <p> We may combine your anonymous or personal visitor session information or other information collected through
        tracking technologies with other personal information collected from you from time to time, in order to
        understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are
        likely to be of interest to you. By accessing our websites and apps via links in an email we have sent and/or by
        accessing our websites and apps where you have identified yourself, you consent to the collection of such
        information where it is personal information.</p>

        <div class="title_p">Platform and Browser Permissions</div>
    <p> You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is
        offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify
        your preferences, please search for ‚Äúcookie‚Äù in the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù portion of your browser.</p>

    <p>Mobile platforms such as iOS and Android generally define certain types of information or data that applications
        cannot access without your consent. Each platform has its own permissions system for obtaining your consent. For
        example, the iOS platform generally alerts you the first time an app wants permission to access certain types of
        data, such as location services, and will let you choose whether or not to consent to that request. Android
        devices will generally notify you of the permissions that an app seeks before you first use the application, and
        your use of the application constitutes your consent. For iOS devices, you can generally manage your platform
        level permissions via the Settings section on your device. For Android devices, you can generally manage your
        platform level permissions.</p>

    <p>Use of information collected and disclosure of personal information to others<div class="title_p">Information that you provide to us</div>
        We collect such personal information so that we can provide you with a better service. We also need this
        information to deliver products and services to you, to complete transactions on your behalf and to better
        understand your requirements and preferences. Personal information collected will be used for the following
        primary purposes:</p>

        information for a purpose related to the primary purpose of collection and where you would reasonably expect
        that we would use the information in such a way (e.g. major delivery companies, mail houses and third-party
        fulfilment contractors). This information is only disclosed to persons outside our business in the circumstances
        set out in this policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection of the information, or with
        your permission.</p>

        - Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious, immediate
        threat to someone‚Äôs health or safety or the public‚Äôs health or safety;
        - Where we reasonably suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or
        disclosure is a necessary part of our investigation or in reporting the matter to the relevant authorities;
        - Where such use or disclosure is required under or authorised by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena, a
        warrant or other order of a court or legal process);
        - Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary for prevention, investigation, prosecution
        and punishment of crimes or wrongdoings or the preparation for, conduct of, proceedings before any court or
        tribunal or the implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal by or on behalf of an enforcement body; and
